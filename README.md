# Hello, I'm Andr√©s Aristiz√°bal! üëã

## About Me üöÄ
I'm currently wrapping up my eight semester in Multimedia Engineering at the **Universidad Aut√≥noma de Occidente**. 
I'm passionate about the power of Python and its applications in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 
I'm also a dedicated gamer and programmer, with a strong interest in developing games using C#.

## My Interests ‚ú®
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Exploring advanced algorithms and neural networks to create intelligent systems.
- **Game Development:** Crafting engaging video games and experimenting with innovative gameplay mechanics.
- **Artificial Intelligence in Games:** Utilizing reinforcement learning to create adaptive and intelligent game behaviors.

## Projects üõ†Ô∏è

### Click and Count
- **Video:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyyoOLAjhYI)
- **Repo:** [ClickAndCount](https://github.com/Felipe-Aristizabal/ClickAndCount)
- **Description:** "Click and Count" is an adrenaline-pumping game where precision and pace go hand in hand. Dive into a world where every click counts, and time is of the essence. Your mission: to click all objects on the screen before time slips away.
With a seamless integration of scenes and a persistent state across transitions, thanks to our dedicated Scene Management system, the gameplay is smooth and uninterrupted. The GameManager stands at the core, diligently tracking your scores and time, making every session a race to beat your best.

### Pneumonia Detection
- **Repo:** [MLDS_U6_PROYECTO_FINAL_ARISTIZABAL_RENDON](https://github.com/SRENDONP/MLDS_U6_PROYECTO_FINAL_ARISTIZABAL_RENDON)
- **Description:** This project involves implementing transfer learning for a machine learning model to detect pneumonia from X-ray images. By leveraging pre-trained models, the project achieves high accuracy and efficiency in classification, contributing significantly to the medical field by optimizing diagnosis and patient management processes.

### Traffic-Sign-Classifier
- **Video:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L51mIgqJ7Gw)
- **Repo:** [Traffic-Sign-Classifier](https://github.com/Felipe-Aristizabal/Traffic-Sign-Classifier)
- **Description:** In a quest to educate fifth graders on road safety, this project presents a real-time traffic sign classifier.
Built with Python and InceptionV3, it's a tool for the young minds in Santiago de Cali to learn about road signs effectively,
with an impressive accuracy rate, thanks to the robust neural network architectures employed.

### SpeechRecognition-ML
- **Repo:** [Tetris-speech-recognition](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/Tetris-speech-recognition)
- **Description:** Dive into the world of voice-controlled gaming with this innovative project. By combining signal processing,
audio feature extraction, and machine learning, this game responds to voice commands in Spanish, offering a hands-free gaming
experience that pushes the boundaries of interactive play.

### RedAndBlackRV
- **Video:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVKjkgNaql0)
- **Repo:** [RedAndBlackRV](https://github.com/Felipe-Aristizabal/RedAndBlackRV)
- **Description:** Experience the thrill of a casino in VR with Red And Black RV. This game, designed for Oculus DK2 and Leap Motion,
places you in the shoes of a university student at a roulette table, gambling tuition fees for a chance to win big. It's a daring blend
of reality and virtual excitement, posing the question: will you risk it all?

## Collaborate with Me ü§ù
I'm on a quest to merge AI with multimedia to not just play games but to create rich, dynamic experiences. If you're interested in 
pushing the boundaries of technology and creativity, I'd love to hear from you!
