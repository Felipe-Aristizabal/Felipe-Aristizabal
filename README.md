## About Me üöÄ
I'm currently wrapping up my eight semester in Multimedia Engineering at the **Universidad Aut√≥noma de Occidente**. 
Diving deep into the realms of coding, I've cultivated a fervent passion for game development, harnessing the versatile power of C# to bring immersive experiences to life.
I'm also passionate about the power of Python and its applications in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

## My Interests ‚ú®
- **Game Development:** Crafting engaging video games and experimenting with innovative gameplay mechanics.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Exploring advanced algorithms and neural networks to create intelligent systems.
- **Artificial Intelligence in Games:** Utilizing reinforcement learning to create adaptive and intelligent game behaviors.
